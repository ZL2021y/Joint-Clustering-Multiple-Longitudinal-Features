# Joint-Clustering-Multiple-Longitudinal-Features

The software codes are prepared by R markdown and include two folders (branches), namely “01. Analysis of epiletpic.qol data” and “02. Analysis of PBC data”, which correspond to the R codes and outputs for analyzing the epiletpic.qol and PBC data, respectively. In each folder, R codes for implementing the gmbt, flexmix, lcmm, mixAK, BCClong and kml3d are described. 
Specifically, the “01. Analysis of epiletpic.qol data” folder includes the following R codes and outputs: 
•	00. Descriptive Statistics.pdf
•	01. gbmt.pdf
•	02. flexmix.pdf
•	03. lcmm.pdf
•	04. mixAK.pdf
•	05. BCClong.pdf
•	06. kml3d.pdf

The “02. Analysis of PBC data” folder includes the following R codes: 
•	00. Descriptive Statistics.pdf
•	01. gbmt.pdf
•	02. flexmix.pdf
•	03. lcmm.pdf
•	04. mixAK.pdf
•	05. BCClong.pdf
•	06. kml3d.pdf
